# TicTacShift

TicTacShift is a modern, real-time, cross-platform mobile version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built with Flutter. It extends traditional gameplay by introducing an infinite, shifting version of Tic-Tac-Toe, where players rotate their pieces after a set number of moves. TicTacShift features real-time multiplayer, offline play, AI opponents, game history review, Firebase integration, leaderboards, and more.
